      "I am very happy to write a recommendation for Noumodong. He has been an absolute pleasure to work with. His skills are very strong in terms of development and coding, but more than that, Noumodong is a very strong team leader. He has an ability to explain complex concepts to very junior or even brand new students to a subject in a crystal clear and practical way. He is very generous with his time, trouble-shooting, and explanations. His kind outlook on life allows people to admit mistakes and confusion without feeling self conscious about admitting defeat. Yet he is not the person who does the work for someone, either. He responds to questions by asking about someone's trouble-shooting process, allowing him to advise them further so next time they can solve the problem independently. In this way, Noumodong makes those around him even better at their tasks. Finally, he is an international person, having lived in multiple countries and speaks multiple languages. This supportive spirit and international view makes Noumodong an excellent candidate for any team.",

Junior exemplifies the values of OpenClassrooms, the most important among them being to care. As a Student Success Manager, my role is to help students overcome obstacles during their training. When students feel particularly discouraged, Junior's experience can be the motivation they need. As someone who has already completed a Path, he offers a unique and invaluable perspective to others.
